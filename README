Right now this is just a tiny Haskell implementation of a Sierpinski's Triangle.

If you provide a whole number argument, the app will generate a still frame with that many layers of recursion.

If you do not provide a number, the app will animate, iterating once per second.

Ok, I'm now working on implementing a maze generator, after which I will try and implement a maze solver.

Right now, I don't have either working.

Ok, so I want to have some way of generating the maze, where I look at each possible wall exactly once, and where all paths can be found easily in a lookup structure of some sort.

Well, I have the grid and walls generated, which took forever!!!!

But I don't have a working maze, or at least no guarantee that you can get from any one point to any other point.

I will get that working later!

But now I upload
